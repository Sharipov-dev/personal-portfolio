                "description": "At Agile Creative Labs, I worked part-time as a Software Developer Intern, where I got to build real tools that people actually used. I created RESTful APIs in Node.js with a MySQL backend to manage product data and track user adventures. I also integrated an AI model from Hugging Face by writing a REST API layer around it, which made sure responses stayed snappy, usually under 100ms. One of my favorite parts was setting up a Java plugin to trim media files and designing a responsive UI with JavaScript and jQuery—it ended up cutting down the team’s manual editing time by nearly half."

One of the highlights was helping the team save over $10,000 in project costs during the term just by developing components in-house instead of outsourcing."

I built a borrower-notification reporting service using Kafka to stream events in real time, which cut alert delivery time from nearly 2 minutes to under 5 seconds for about 50,000 borrowers a day. I also created a full-stack Java log viewer with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, adding backend pagination and search filters that made debugging large log sets 60% faster. One of the biggest wins was refactoring a legacy Spring Boot module by using Java Streams, caching, and async calls, I doubled its speed and reduced CPU usage by around 40% in load tests. I also wrote unit and integration tests with JUnit and Mockito, hitting 85% code coverage and catching two bugs before they made it to QA."
